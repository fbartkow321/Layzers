# Layzers

This is a board game called Layzers. The objective of the game is to fire a laser and have it traverse the board, bouncing off of mirrors, until you destroy the other player's Ruler. 

Most of the code that controls the game engine has been written. At this point, I need to develop a GUI, and I'm not 100% sure how I'd like to go about doing that yet. I'm open to any suggestions/ideas. I'm also open to critiques on my code. I've been writing code for a while now, but I know I'm far from the best. I'll take any help I can get!
